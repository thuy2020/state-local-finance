In some areas, K-12 education agencies do not issue audited financial statements because they operate as part of a city or county government. In this section, we consider only independent school districts, which have their own financial reports.

Large independent school districts reported less extreme levels than cities, with none exceeding 400%. Among the largest school districts by enrollment, the Chicago Board of Education had the highest liability to revenue ratio at 396%.

Other districts with ratios of 300% or higher were Frisco Independent School District, TX, Los Angeles Unified School District, CA, San Diego Unified School District, CA, and Cypress-Fairbanks Independent School District, TX in descending order.

Among GASB-compliant entities, the lowest ratio, 25%, was reported by Baltimore City Public School System, MD. This district benefits from the fact that the state has sole responsibility for its unfunded pension liability and the city has sole responsibility for its unfunded OPEB liability. Other large school districts with low liability to revenue ratios (below 85%) in ascending order were Board of Education of Shelby County, TN, Osceola County District School Board, FL, District School Board of Pinellas County, FL, Duval County Public Schools, FL, and Sarasota County District School Board, FL.
