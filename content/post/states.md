In this map, and those that follow, governments that have relatively high ratios of liabilities to revenue are shown in red, while those with lower ratio are green. The three states with the highest liabilities relative to revenue are New Jersey, Illinois, and Connecticut, all of which have deeply unfunded state pension systems. Wyoming and Hawaii rounded out the top five.


States with low liability-to-revenue ratios include Tennessee, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Idaho, and Iowa in that order.
