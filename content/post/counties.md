Of the county governments we analyzed, Titus County, in northeastern Texas, had the highest ratio of liabilities to revenues, at 723%. Almost all the countyâ€™s debt stemmed from bonds. Its $114 million in bonded debt amounted to over $3600 per resident.


Other counties with ratios exceeding 400% were Nassau County, NY, Wilson County, TN, Ohio County, WV and Dickens County, TX. Of these, Nassau County is by far the largest. About 44% of its $14.5 billion of reported liabilities stemmed from unfunded retiree healthcare obligations.


Many counties have not produced audited financial reports for fiscal year 2020. In most of these cases, the county was not required to produce an audit. In New England, many counties do not have governing bodies. Elsewhere, the county government does not meet thresholds for reporting. In other cases, a county is required to produce a financial statement but is very late in doing so.


Most counties in New Jersey, Arkansas and some midwestern states do not adhere to government accounting standards and thus report no liabilities as well or only some types of liabilities, so their ratios are not comparable to counties in the majority of states where GASB standards are regularly used.


Among counties with over 100,000 population that follow government accounting standards, Walworth County WI had the lowest liability to revenue ratio of less than 13%. Its pension plan (part of the Wisconsin Retirement System) and its OPEB plan were both fully funded. Weld County, CO had the second lowest ratio, 15%, Its pension plan was also fully funded.
